**Lavender's Blue** is a simple tune in the right hand only that uses the first six notes of the scale of C Major. For the lowest five notes **C D E F** and **G** use all the fingers or your right hand - one for each note. (With your **thumb** on **C** and your **little finger** on **G**). Then for **A** just stretch your **little finger** to reach that note.

> **Hint:** _To help find the notes ensure **Show Note Names** are turned on from **Setup Preferences** menu._
