This is a simplified version of **Clair De La Lune** that uses only the three notes **C D** and **E** from your right hand. First find **middle C** and always use your **thumb** for this note, then for **D** use your **first finger** and for **E** use **middle finger**.

> **Hint:** _If you are a complete beginner try the pieces from the **Beginner Course** first._
