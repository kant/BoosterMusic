**Down And Up** is mirror version of the Up And Down piece we played earlier but this version uses your **left hand**. These are the top five notes of the scale of C major. Again try to use all your fingers.

Use your **thumb** for **C**, your **index finger** for **B**, . . . , all the way down to your **little finger** for **F**.

> **Hint:** _Make sure you use **every finger** on your **left hand** when playing this piece._
