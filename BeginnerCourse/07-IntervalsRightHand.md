**Intervals Right Hand** contains all the melodic intervals (sequences of two notes) one can play with the first five notes of the scale of C major.

Similarly to the Up and Down piece we played earlier, use your **thumb** for **C**, your **index finger** for **D**, . . . , all the way up to your **little finger** for **G**. Make sure you keep using the correct finger for each note.

> **Hint:** _If reading a melody with large intervals is difficult, remember you can **label the piano keys** using the PianoBooster **Note Chart**_
