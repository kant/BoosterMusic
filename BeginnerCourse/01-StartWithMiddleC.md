**Start With Middle C** is an extremely easy piece. Just find **middle C** on the piano and then play that note four times using your **thumb** on your **right hand**. The first half of the piece has **middle C** in the **Treble Clef**, then for the second half of the piece the same **middle C** note is shown the **Bass Clef**. Play this using your **thumb** on your **left hand**.

> **Hint:** _Try to remember where **Middle C** is on the piano - this is the most **important note**!_
