This is a simplified version of **Clair De La Lune** that uses just three notes **C D** and **E** from your right hand. First find **middle C** and always use your **thumb** for this note, then for **D** use your **first finger** and for **E** use **middle finger**.

> **Hint:** _Remember the fingering: Use your **thumb** for **middle C**, your **first finger** for **D** and **middle finger** for **E**._
