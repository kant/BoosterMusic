# Piano Booster Music

> Welcome the the new repository for Piano Booster Music.

These pieces of music have been created to work with **PianoBooster** and
have the creative commons copyright.

_Please add to the music on this page  - everyone can help._ For more information see this
[forum post](http://piano-booster.2625608.n2.nabble.com/Creating-music-for-PianoBooster-using-MMA-Everyone-can-help-td4167350.html).

The piano parts for **PianoBooster** were created using the [ABC Plus music](http://abcplus.sourceforge.net/) system,
and the accompaniment was created with the [Musical MIDI Accompaniment (MMA)](http://www.mellowood.ca/mma/).

The music in these directories has already been built to  generate the MIDI files and PDF sheet music that work with **PianoBooster**.
Please see the [BoosterMusicBooks.zip](../BoosterMusicBooks.zip) zip file.


## Creating the MIDI files and PDF sheet music

Only if you are contributing new pieces of music
or the translations have been updated will you need to run the script `makemusic.py`.

Ensure that the following packages are installed:
`python3`, `abcm2ps`, `abcmidi`, `mma`, `pandoc`, `po4a`, `zip`

To create an updated  `BoosterMusicBooks.zip` file run the script `makemusic.py`.
This script has only been tested to work on Linux OS.
